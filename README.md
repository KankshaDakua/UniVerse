## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   npm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/universe-app.git
    cd universe-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    You can get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the result.

5.  **(Optional) Seed the Database:**
    To populate your Firestore database with initial data for canteen items, run the seeding script:

    ```
    This ensures the canteen analytics and ordering features work correctly from the start.
